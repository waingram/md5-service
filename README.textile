h1. md5-service

This micro-service allows you to post a url that points to a file.  The service will then download that file, run it through md5sum and return the checksum.

Example:

This would generate md5 checksum for the content of the "original" datastream in a Fedora object with pid chagneme:20

http://localhost:3000/md5?url=http://localhost:8983/fedora/objects/changeme:20/datastreams/original/content

h2. Known Issues

* assumes UNIX/Linux with md5sum installed
